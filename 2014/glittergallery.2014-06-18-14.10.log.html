<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">14:11:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> what are our options?
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">14:11:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> one is to put it up on github
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">14:11:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> we have github pages, maybe we could store it on /meetings
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">14:11:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> where are they currently stored?

<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">14:13:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> banas, for the first meeting, you posted the logs - not minutes, though
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">14:13:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yeah it wasnt a meetbot generated one

<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">14:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> rohitpaulk, (or rohitpaulphone) can you give us a quick status update? - what you're working on currently, if you're blocked by anything, etc
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">14:18:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> I'm working on the rugged integration now.
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">14:18:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> All the existing code has been moved over.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">14:18:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> The file update action which we had problems with before - that's completed too.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">14:18:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> Now I'm going to look into forking.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">14:19:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> Nothing blocking my way, but I'm blocking Sarup's way as of now. There are a few routing changes that have to be done to make sure that the login pages show up properly
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">14:19:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> So yh. Forking, and login page changes - that's what I'm on now. Once that's done, tests for both.
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">14:19:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> great!
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">14:19:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rohitpaul:</span> that's cool, we can just merge them when you're ready with them. we have at least the email support for now :)
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">14:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> Yh :)
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">14:20:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> for login - do all the methods currently work? external providers/openid/username+pass ? or is that in progress?

<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">14:22:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> great!
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">14:22:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulphone&gt;</span> not on local though, coz the callback URLs have to be publicly accessible :)

<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">14:23:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> banas - it's your turn :)
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">14:24:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I'm done with major part of the redesign, you can test it on glittery-banas as usual :) now I'll soon move to providing project settings and fix more page UI as I progress :)
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">14:24:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> banas, and you're waiting on login page changes?
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">14:25:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yeah, but it isn;t critical.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">14:25:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> currently, theres email pass that works
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">14:25:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> and a signup page
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">14:25:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> just that people have to click few extra buttons to get there
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">14:25:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> and the 3rd party works with rohitpaul's PR, but it needs some routing improvements for the new buttons
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">14:26:30 </span><span class="nka">* banas</span> <span class="ac">wished OpenID's standard orange was not so orange, it looks out of place</span>
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">14:27:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> @banas - the openID login page has a default styling. Were you able to redo that?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">14:28:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I was also hoping to try a new set of fonts, but the current ones arent bad so I'll do that when I'm more free :D
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">14:28:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rohitpaulk_:</span>  the page from your PR?
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">14:29:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> Not exactly - This omniauth-openID creates a page of it's own
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">14:29:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> where you have to enter your OpenID login.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">14:30:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> it's the blank page with just a textbox, right?
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">14:30:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I saw a page like that, but I haven't styled it yet
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">14:30:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> I did find some styling problems there... As in, if I'd just click through - it'd have our original background. And when i refresh that page, the styles change to a default grey background
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">14:31:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> Yh I'm guessing it's a turbolinks issues... Let me know when you get there, I think that this will need a bit of investigation
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">14:31:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> issue*
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">14:31:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> Yeah, for openid, what I wanted to do is to make the openid login field appear on the same homepage (replacing the email/pass areaq) when the user clicks the button
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">14:31:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> so I'll work on it when I involve some js
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">14:32:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> Aah that's a good idea.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">14:33:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yep :)

<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">14:35:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yeh I just noticed you sent me an email, I'll look at it after the meeting :) thanks for the hints!

<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">14:37:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> (to be more specific ;)
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">14:37:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> haha, yeah
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">14:37:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> alright, so just to fill rohitpaul in
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">14:38:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> currently, design team is working on the branding for fedora.next
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">14:38:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> websites, logos, etc
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">14:38:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> as soon as we can, it would be cool to release an early deployment for them to be able to use
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">14:39:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> yh that sounds good :)
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">14:39:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> so they can report/fix bugs, and we're working on a track that solves the problems that need most attention
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">14:39:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk_&gt;</span> though... there's a lot of work that we need to get done before something like that. What timeframe are we expecting?
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">14:39:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Emichan:</span> so which features do you think make most sense?
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">14:41:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> The basics, obviously: creating a project, adding files to it, and commenting
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">14:41:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> which should all work unless one of you has broken it ;)
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">14:41:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulphone&gt;</span> Not yet :D
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">14:41:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> authentication with openid is a definite requirement
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">14:42:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yeh, so that's something we currently have. but, the commenting needs notifications IMO, without which its pretty unusable
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">14:42:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> forking is not absolutely necessary, but i'd really like to see it working
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">14:43:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> yes, commenting without notifications isn't great - at least notifications for the project owner. but i'm not sure we want to be blocked on that necessarily.
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">14:44:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Emichan:</span> yep. I propose let paul finish what he is currently working on, and we could work out some adjustments in the schedule to facilitate the release. what do you think?
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">14:44:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I'll look at the commenting, I don't mind deviating a little
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">14:45:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I think he got disconnected though
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">14:45:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulphone&gt;</span> I'm on phone.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">14:45:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> oh cool :)
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">14:46:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulphone&gt;</span> We we planning for notifications in the next iteration right?
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">14:46:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> i think that's fine. What about the redesign, banas? will you be able to finish it up for the release?
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">14:46:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulphone&gt;</span> Oh wait that was the issue tracker...
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">14:46:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> i think we can reorder the notifications and the issue tracker.
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">14:47:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulphone&gt;</span> Yh that makes sense to me
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">14:47:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yeah i think the issue tracker came first according to the plan, but i dont thinkit will mess up if we switch
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">14:47:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Emichan:</span> yep i will
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">14:48:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Emichan:</span> most of the elements are there, it's just plugging in at the right places.

<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">14:54:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> OK I was saying that multiple uploads would be a good feature to have in 0.1
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">14:54:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> multiple files at a time? makes sense
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">14:54:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> for the project images?
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">14:54:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> do you have space in the schedule for that?
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">14:55:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> Coz a person starting a project just wants to dump his current work... And uploading one by one is a PITA
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">14:55:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> if it's project images, I'm already on it
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">14:55:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> for the project images, yes.
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">14:56:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> but I think what people would love most would be a sparkleshare connect, although I have no idea what we need to support it
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">14:56:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> It'd involve JS right? Cool let me know if you need any help
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">14:56:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> yeah, sparkleshare integration would be great
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">14:56:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AndChat|554609:</span> i will!
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">14:57:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Emichan:</span> when you and mizmo presented at LGM, that prototype had a sparleshare connection?
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">14:57:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> banas, not at all
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">14:58:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> banas, that prototype barely did anything ;)
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">14:58:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> I don't expect the integration to be easy. If we really want it in 0.1, we should start fast
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">14:58:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> ah ok. then maybe we can release PRs for 0.2 and sparkleshare for 0.3
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">14:59:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AndChat|554609:</span> I'm against sparkleshare for 0.1. we most likely wont have the time
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">14:59:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#agreed</span><span class="cmdline"></span>
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">14:59:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> but we could actually do sparkleshare for 0.2
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">15:00:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> and do PRs for 0.3
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">15:00:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> We'll see if we get RFEs for either
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">15:00:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> And then decide?
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">15:00:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AndChat|554609:</span> yeah, good idea :)
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">15:01:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> we don't really need rfe's for those, I think they're clearly features we want
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">15:01:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> i'd say sparkleshare first, then PRs
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">15:01:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> mizmo and ryan both said sparkleshare first
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">15:01:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">15:01:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> Ok :)
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">15:01:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AndChat|554609:</span> it will be a smoother learning curve for you as well, IMO
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">15:02:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> True
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">15:02:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> design team doesn;t really do as much forking and then PR-ing,, they tend to just work on multiple ideas simultaneously from what I've observed
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">15:02:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> it'd also be good to try to allow importing an existing repo (i.e. hosted on github) for 0.2 or 0.3
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">15:03:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> it's common to build on other people's work for the wallpaper at least
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">15:03:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> forking will make that easier
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">15:03:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> i'm not sure PRs would be used all that much even so
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">15:03:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Emichan:</span> yeah
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">15:04:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> more likely, it's going to be "hey, i made these cool patterns", and somebody will fork it and improve and show links to their work
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">15:05:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">15:05:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> Although, AndChat|554609 you can read about what it takes to get sparkleshare itegrated, see if you're comfortable and then we can decide
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">15:05:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AndChat|554609&gt;</span> Yep I'll have a look
