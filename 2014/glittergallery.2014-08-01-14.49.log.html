<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">14:49:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yay
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">14:50:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> \o/
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">14:50:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> So Waartaa to the rescue today :D
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">14:50:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">14:51:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> alright, so I guess we should start with the status updates? :) I kind of need to leave early
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">14:52:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> yep, let's start
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">14:52:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">Sarup status update</span>
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">14:52:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I've been working on slideshows
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">14:53:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> it's done for most of the part actually
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">14:53:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> there's one problem - the content within the placeholder isn't getting styled, so I'm figuring out what I'm missing
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">14:54:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> glittery-banas was building a while back, so if the assets are good, I can provide a link in a few minutes
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">14:54:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> the off-canvas works too :)
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">14:54:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> for larger devices, nothing changes; for smaller devices, there's a nice slide-in for the navigation
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">14:54:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I still need to style it further though
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">14:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> I had a look at the off-canvas nav, looks cool! :)
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">14:55:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> next in place, I'm hoping to improve the notifications front end, if thats good, we're ready 0.1 wise I think
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">14:56:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> that's all for now
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">14:56:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> thanks Paul!
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">14:57:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> send out a link when it's done!
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">14:57:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> i'd like to see it
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">14:57:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yep, I will.
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">14:58:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> hopefully, I don't need to change anything for it to work on production properly
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">14:59:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> Shall I?
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:00:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> as expected, the assets need to be looked after, but here's the general thing http://glittery-banas.rhcloud.com/sarupbanskota/Helloworld
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:00:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rohitpaulk:</span> sure

<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:00:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> I'm now working on getting tests passed
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:01:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> Hopefully by tomorrow we'll have all tests passing on Travis
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:01:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> Once that's done, I'm going to setup emails for notifications
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:01:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> And the login seems to have magically fixed itself :P
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:01:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> GitHub login, that is
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:02:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> It's working now for both me and Sarup
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:02:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> great
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:02:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> That's all for now. The issue tracker is functional now, by the way :)
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:02:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> awesome!
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:03:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> banas, how much time do you have left
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:03:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> for being online?
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:03:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:04:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I can stay, no problem. just that I haven't slept for 2 straight nights
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:04:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> and I'm very sleepy :P
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:04:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> okay, well, let's go to the next topic but try to keep it short so you can sleep
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:04:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> yep sure :)
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:04:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">release criteria</span>
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:05:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> have you guys had a chance to put together any bugs/feature blockers for 0.1 release?
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:06:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> Until now I had login on the list. But now that seems to be fixed. (facebook is working too, just checked)
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:06:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> I was hoping to do it tomorrow morning actually, since it was my last 2 days in college before the travel.
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:07:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> I think once we have the emails too, we have a pretty 'useful' app.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:07:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> worth a release, i mean.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:07:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> banas, did you get the quickstart working? or do you need some help with that?
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:07:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> as for my issues, I basically wanted to improve the slider + make the assets work for the slideshow.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:07:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Emichan:</span> I'll need some help with it :/
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:08:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> banas, okay - can you open an issue and assign it to me?
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:08:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> you can do it tomorrow ;)
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:08:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> sure, I'll do it!
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:08:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> And we had some contributor activity yesterday...
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> thank you :) but please do let me know how you went about it, so I can follow as well
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:08:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rohitpaulk&gt;</span> don't know if you noticed

<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:13:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> just be extra diligent about keeping me informed if you run into any issues - or get blocked by anything
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:13:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> that's true
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:13:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banas&gt;</span> but I'll make up by 18th, I'm quite confident

<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:16:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Emichan&gt;</span> eastern europe is cheaper than western europe
